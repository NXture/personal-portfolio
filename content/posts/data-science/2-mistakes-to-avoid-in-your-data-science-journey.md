Ever since I started my data science learning journey, I feel like I've accomplished a great deal of stuff. Amidst those accomplishments, I also see some mistakes that shine crystal clear.

I don't regret making those mistakes. I believe we all learn from our mistakes and I also did. However, I would have a more productive learning path without them.

In this article, I would like to share 2 main mistakes that every student or beginners should avoid while pursuing data science career.

#### 1. Too much watching üëìüíª

It is really hard and challenging to learn data science. What makes it hard is not a lack of resources. I think there is a tremendous amount of resources to learn data science. They are offered in various forms such as video and tutorials, articles, MOOC( Massive Open Online Courses ) courses, micro degrees, and so on.

Having lots of resources does not assure an efficient and productive learning path. We need to choose and use them wisely. Otherwise, we would be wasting some amount of time.

At the beginning of my data science journey, I was spending most of my time watching video tutorials. They were clearly explaining the key terms and concepts. Most of them were easy to follow as well. I felt like I was learning at a very good pace.

It did not take me long to realize that I was just understanding, not learning. I think there is a big fallacy associated with watching video tutorials. Since they clearly explain stuff, you fell like you learn. However, you just understand.

I've read few research studies that suggest active engagement is a prerequisite for change in the brain. Not surprisingly, just listening to a presentation or lecture will not lead to learning.

We need to engage in with active learning. In most cases, it cannot be achieved with watching video tutorials. We need more sessions of practicing. Hands-on tutorials take time but they are definitely more efficient than learning.

Avoid spending long hours watching video tutorials. Instead, you should try to tackle down challenging problems. When you are solving such problems, you will likely to encounter obstacles that are not covered in the video tutorials and MOOC courses. Thus, it is an excellent resource for learning.

#### 2. Doing actual projects instead of just a project üìê

For students and beginners, we usually do not have any prior job experience, and the best way to showcase and demonstrate your skills is to do projects. There is a ton of blogs posts and articles the emphasize the importance and effectiveness of projects for aspiring data scientists to succeed there career.

There is nothing wrong about doing projects. I also did some of my own. The problem is that most of the commonplace projects are not challenging enough. A project that you can complete in a day or two is not likely to attract hiring managers.

Those projects are good for learning and practicing. However, relying on them to find a job is a mistake. Instead of completing a dozen of such projects, you should try to complete a project that stands out.

Being a data scientist is not just about using tools and packages. Data scientists should be able to identify a problem that can be solved with data. Then, they design and implement a solution. A project that shows you have the skill of using data to find a solution is a game changer.

You should avoid focusing on completing several piece-of-cake projects. Instead, you should try to come up with an original idea. It is not an easy task but if you manage that, you can attract a handful of hiring managers and recruiters.

#### Final Thoughts

It is important to note that your learning style or journey might be totally different than mine. If so, I suggest focusing on techniques to make your learning journey as efficient as possible. Time is the most valuable resource after all.
